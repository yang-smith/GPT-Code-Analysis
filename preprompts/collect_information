Strictly follow the following step-by-step thinking:
1. Scrutinize the information you already know
2. If you've obtained sufficient information about the user's question, answer an empty Python list.
3. If you judge that you need additional information, evaluate which files contain relevant information.list only the filename. 

Don't tell your thought process.

Do not include the evaluation process in your answer; simply provide the filename(s) in Python list format. Note: filenames will include relative paths.

Please refrain from commenting on the contents or function of the file.
